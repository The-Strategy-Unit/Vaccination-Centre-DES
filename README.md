Modelling of Discrete Event Simulation (DES) for vaccination centres

This repository is for creating DES models of COVID-19 vaccination centres. The model was initially built by Wolverhampton ICS but was then developed and parameterised into a more generic model by the Strategy Unit Team. 

## Repository structure
### Instructions
Instructions on use of the Strategy Unit model and excel file can be found here: xxxx

### Prerequisites
If you want to run the model on your computer you will need to have JaamSim installed to run the model and Excel to analyse the results using our template. 
Click [here](https://jaamsim.com/downloads.html) to choose the appropriate version of the JaamSim program to download and install. Detailed instructions on installation and using JaamSim can be found in the [JaamSim manual](https://jaamsim.com/docs/JaamSim%20User%20Manual%202021-01.pdf). Please ensure that you have an appropriate version of Java and your graphics drivers are up to date.

### Model
SU VacCentre DES 2021-01-29.cfg file can be dowloaded and opened in JaamSim. The parameters can be changed on screen and when run the model produces a .dat file of the results. The .cfg file can also be edited if you want to adapt the model.

### Excel Output
An excel template has been provided to paste the .dat file results into to show a summary of the results.

## Next Steps
We welcome discussion and ideas on developing this model and would be interested to hear if others find it useful. Please get in touch.
