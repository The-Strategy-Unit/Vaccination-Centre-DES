Modelling of Discrete Event Simulation (DES) for vaccination centres

This repository is for creating DES model of COVID-19 vaccination centres. The model was initially built by Wolverhampton ICS but was then developed into a more generic model by the Strategy Unit Team.

## Repository structure
### Model. 
SU VacCentre DES 2021-01-29.cfg file can be dowloaded and edited. If you want to run the model on your computer you will need to have JaamSim installed. Click [here] (https://jaamsim.com/downloads.html) to choose the appropriate version of the JaamSim program to download and install. Detailed instructions can be found in the [JaamSim manual] (https://jaamsim.com/docs/JaamSim%20User%20Manual%202021-01.pdf). Please ensure that you have an appropriate version of Java and your graphics drivers are up to date.

Once JaamSim is installed you can open your model and unpdate input parameters. For full instructions please go to the Instuctions file.
